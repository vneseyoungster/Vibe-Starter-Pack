# Claude Code Instruction

## RQPIV Workflow System

This project uses the RQPIV (Research, Question, Plan, Implement, Validate)
workflow system for all development tasks.

**⚠️ CRITICAL: All workflow execution MUST be done through slash commands. Never execute workflow phases manually - always use the commands defined in `.claude/commands/`.**

## Command-Driven Architecture

### Command Location
```
.claude/commands/     # All workflow commands
.claude/agents/       # All sub-agent definitions
```

### Available Commands

| Command | Location | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| `/start` | `.claude/commands/start.md` | Execute full workflow (R→Q→P→I→V) |
| `/research` | `.claude/commands/research.md` | Research, question, and plan phases |
| `/execute` | `.claude/commands/execute.md` | Implementation phase |
| `/code-check` | `.claude/commands/code-check.md` | Validation phase |
| `/quick-fix` | `.claude/commands/quick-fix.md` | Fast fixes (bug fixes, typos, config changes) |
| `/project-scan` | `.claude/commands/project-scan.md` | Scan codebase and generate documentation |

### Usage

```bash
/start [feature description]      # Full automated workflow
/research [task]                  # Research + Question + Plan
/execute [task]                   # Implementation only
/code-check [task]                # Validation only
/quick-fix [problem]              # Fast fixes for known problems
/project-scan [target]            # Scan codebase, generate documentation
```

## Workflow Enforcement Rules

1. **NEVER** execute workflow phases directly in the main context
2. **ALWAYS** invoke the appropriate slash command to start any workflow
3. **ALWAYS** delegate research tasks to sub-agents defined in `.claude/agents/`
4. **NEVER** skip the command layer - commands contain critical orchestration logic

## Sub-Agent Definitions

All agents are defined in `.claude/agents/` directory:

### Research Agents (Phase R)
| Agent File | Purpose | Model |
|------------|---------|-------|
| `codebase-explorer.md` | Project structure mapping | haiku |
| `module-researcher.md` | Deep module analysis | sonnet |
| `frontend-researcher.md` | Frontend architecture | sonnet |
| `backend-researcher.md` | Backend architecture | sonnet |
| `dependency-researcher.md` | Package analysis | haiku |
| `pattern-researcher.md` | Convention detection | sonnet |

### Questioning Agents (Phase Q)
| Agent File | Purpose | Model |
|------------|---------|-------|
| `requirement-analyst.md` | Requirement validation | opus |

### Planning Agents (Phase P)
| Agent File | Purpose | Model |
|------------|---------|-------|
| `solution-architect.md` | Architecture design | opus |
| `task-planner.md` | Task breakdown | sonnet |

### Implementation Agents (Phase I)
| Agent File | Purpose | Model |
|------------|---------|-------|
| `backend-developer.md` | Server-side code | sonnet |
| `frontend-developer.md` | Client-side code | sonnet |
| `database-specialist.md` | Database operations | sonnet |

### Validation Agents (Phase V)
| Agent File | Purpose | Model |
|------------|---------|-------|
| `code-reviewer.md` | Code quality | inherit |
| `test-automator.md` | Test creation | sonnet |
| `security-auditor.md` | Security review | sonnet |
| `documentation-writer.md` | Documentation | haiku |

### Orchestration
| Agent File | Purpose | Model |
|------------|---------|-------|
| `workflow-orchestrator.md` | Phase coordination | opus |

## Artifact Locations

| Type | Location |
|------|----------|
| Research findings | `docs/research/` |
| Requirements | `docs/specs/` |
| Architecture | `docs/plans/` |
| Implementation plans | `docs/plans/` |
| Review reports | `docs/reviews/` |
| Session data | `plans/sessions/` |

## Quality Gates

### Research → Execute
- All research artifacts created
- All blocking questions answered
- Requirements document approved
- Architecture approved by user
- Implementation plan approved by user

### Execute → Validate
- All tasks completed
- Deviations documented

### Validate → Complete
- Code review passed (no critical issues)
- Tests passed
- Security audit passed (no critical vulnerabilities)
- Documentation updated

## Best Practices

1. **Command-First**: Always start with a slash command - never bypass the command layer
2. **Context Preservation**: Commands delegate to sub-agents to keep main context clean
3. **Documentation**: Store all findings in appropriate `docs/` directories
4. **User Confirmation**: Never skip questioning phase - always clarify requirements
5. **Plan Adherence**: Follow approved plans exactly, document any deviations
6. **Quality First**: Never skip validation phase
7. **Session Tracking**: Use session directories for complex features

## When User Requests Development Work

**DO THIS:**
```
User: "Add a new login feature"
→ Respond: "I'll start the RQPIV workflow for this feature."
→ Execute: /start Add a new login feature
```

**DON'T DO THIS:**
```
User: "Add a new login feature"
→ Start researching the codebase directly
→ Start implementing without using commands
```
