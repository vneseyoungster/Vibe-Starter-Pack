# 🎉 Vibe-Starter-Pack

**Stop stressing. Start vibing.** ✨

Building apps should feel like fun, not like pulling teeth. Whether you're a total beginner or just hate the boring parts of coding, this starter pack turns Claude Code into your chill coding buddy that actually *gets* what you want.

## 🤔 What's This All About?

You know that feeling when you have an awesome app idea but don't know where to start? Or when coding tutorials make your eyes glaze over? **Yeah, we fixed that.**

Vibe-Starter-Pack uses a simple 5-step flow called **RQPIV**:

> **R**esearch → **Q**uestion → **P**lan → **I**mplement → **V**alidate

Translation: Claude figures stuff out, asks you what you actually want, makes a plan, builds it, then double-checks everything works. You just... vibe. 🎧

## 🚀 Getting Started (It's Easy, Promise!)

Drop these files into your project folder:

```bash
cp -r .claude /path/to/your/project/
cp -r docs /path/to/your/project/
cp CLAUDE.md /path/to/your/project/
```

That's it. You're ready to vibe.

## 💫 How to Use It

### The Easy Way (Just Type This!)

```
/rqpiv Add a login page with cool animations
```

Boom. Claude handles everything. It'll ask you questions when it needs your input, show you the plan before building, and make sure everything works at the end.

### Want More Control? Go Step-by-Step

```
/rqpiv-start Add a shopping cart       # Tell Claude what you want
/phase-question                         # Claude asks clarifying questions
/phase-plan                             # See the game plan before building
/phase-implement                        # Watch the magic happen
/phase-validate                         # Make sure it's all good
```

## 🎯 What Actually Happens

1. **You share your idea** → "I want users to be able to save their favorite items"

2. **Claude does the homework** → Looks at your project, figures out how things work

3. **You chat it out** → Claude asks questions like "Should favorites sync across devices?"

4. **You approve the plan** → See exactly what's getting built before any code is written

5. **Code gets written** → Following YOUR approved plan

6. **Quality check** → Tests, security review, the works

No surprises. No confusion. Just vibes. 😎

## 💡 Pro Tips for Maximum Vibes

- **Be specific!** "Add a dark mode toggle in the settings" > "make it look better"
- **Answer the questions** - They help Claude build exactly what you want
- **Check the plan** - 2 minutes of review saves hours of "wait that's not what I meant"
- **Don't skip validation** - Future you will thank present you

Open `CLAUDE.md` and tell Claude about your project:

- Any special rules or preferences

The more Claude knows, the better it vibes with your project.
